PROJECT1:
A Python calculator is a simple program that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can be built using basic Python functions or advanced libraries like NumPy for scientific calculations. Users can create a command-line calculator with the `input()` function or a GUI-based one using Tkinter or PyQt. Pythonâ€™s versatility makes it ideal for financial, statistical, and scientific computations.
Python provides powerful capabilities for performing calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematical operations. The built-in `math` module offers functions like square roots, trigonometry, logarithms, and more. Python also supports libraries such as NumPy for advanced numerical computations and SymPy for symbolic mathematics. Additionally, Python's floating-point arithmetic follows IEEE 754 standards, ensuring precision. For financial calculations, the `decimal` module helps manage precise decimal arithmetic, while `fractions` allows for exact fraction representation. Python's flexibility makes it a preferred choice for scientific computing and data analysis.
PROJECT2:
A portfolio is a professional compilation of an individual's work, used to showcase skills, experience, and accomplishments. It is widely used in creative fields like graphic design, photography, writing, and architecture, as well as in business, finance, and technology. A strong portfolio typically includes a bio or introduction, work samples, case studies, testimonials, and contact information. Digital portfolios, hosted on websites or platforms like Behance and GitHub, allow easy access and sharing. An effective portfolio highlights the best work, demonstrating expertise, creativity, and problem-solving abilities to potential employers or clients.
